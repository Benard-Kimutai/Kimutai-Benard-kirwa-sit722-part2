6.2P: Cloud-Native DevOps Project(Part2 of 5)
Background
Our University Library is a cornerstone of academic resources, aims to enhanceaccessibility to educational materials through an advanced online platform. Youhas been asked to develop a cloud-native microservices architecture to supportthelibraryâ€™s diverse user base and streamline deployment processes. This project isdivided into 5 parts as follows:
No. Title Task1 Deploying Microservice with PostgreSQL on Render Task4.2P2 Containerizing Microservices with Docker and Deploying to Local
Kubernetes
Task6.2P3 Containerizing Microservices with Docker and Deploying to Azure
Managed Kubernetes
Task7.2P4 Infrastructure as Code with Terraform Task8.2C5 CI/CD with Github Actions using Terraform Task9.2DBy end of this project, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of essential
DevOps practices and cloud-native application deployment techniques. Morespecifically, you will be able to do following:
1. Create Dockerfiles to containerize application and define the runtimeenvironment. 2. Develop Kubernetes YAML files (deployment.yaml and service.yaml) todeployand manage their microservice on Azure managed Kubernetes cluster. 3. Write Terraform scripts (main.tf, variables.tf, outputs.tf, provider.tf) toprovision Azure infrastructure. 4. Deploy Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and integrate PostgreSQL for datastorage. 5. Configure GitHub Actions workflows to automate the CI/CD pipeline. 6. Apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios, enhancing their
understanding of cloud computing and DevOps principles.
SIT722 Software Deployment and Operation Task6.2P-Cloud2024/T2 1/3
Tasks
In this task, you are continuing work from the previous project, focusingonDockerizing the book_catalog microservice and deploying it to Local Kubernetes.This task builds upon previous efforts, emphasizing practical skills in
containerization, database integration with PostgreSQL, and deployment
orchestration with Kubernetes in a local development environment. By theendofthis project, you will gain hands-on experience in setting up and managingcontainerized applications, leveraging Kubernetes for scalability and managementefficiencies.
